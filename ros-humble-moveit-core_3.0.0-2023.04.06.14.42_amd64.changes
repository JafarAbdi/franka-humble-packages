   * Add default constructors
     ... as they are not implicitly declared anymore
   * Add default copy/move constructors/assignment operators
     As a user-declared destructor deletes any implicitly-defined move constructor/assignment operator,
     we need to declared them manually. This in turn requires to declare the copy constructor/assignment as well.
   * Fix GoogleTestVerification.UninstantiatedTypeParameterizedTestSuite
   * Modernize gtest: TYPED_TEST_CASE -> TYPED_TEST_SUITE
   * Fix warning: expression with side effects will be evaluated
   * Fix warning: definition of implicit copy assignment operator is deprecated
   * Cleanup msg includes: Use C++ instead of C header (#1844 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1844>)
   * Fix trajectory unwind bug (#1772 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1772>)
     * ensure trajectory starting point's position is enforced
     * fix angle jump bug
     * handle bounds enforcement edge case
     * clang tidy
     * Minor renaming, better comment, use .at() over []
     * First shot at a unit test
     * fix other unwind bugs
     * test should succeed now
     * unwind test needs a model with a continuous joint
     * clang tidy
     * add test for unwinding from wound up robot state
     * clang tidy
     * tweak test for special case to show that it will fail without these changes

   * Use adjustable waypoint batch sizes for Ruckig (#1719 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1719>)
     * Use adjustable waypoint batch sizes for Ruckig
     * Use std::optional for return value
     * Cleanup
     * Add comment about parameterizing
     * Fix potential segfault
     * Batch size argument
     * Use append()
     * Revert "Use append()"
     This reverts commit 96b86a6c783b05ba57e5a6a20bf901cd92ab74d7.
   * Fix moveit_core dependency on tf2_kdl (#1817 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1817>)
     This is a proper dependency, and not only a test dependency. It is still
     needed when building moveit_core with -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF.
   * Bug fix: RobotTrajectory append() (#1813 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1813>)
     * Add a test for append()
     * Don't add to the timestep, rather overwrite it
   * Print a warning from TOTG if the robot model mixes revolute/prismatic joints (#1799 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1799>)
   * Tiny optimizations in enforcePositionBounds() for RevoluteJointModel (#1803 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1803>)
   * Better TOTG comments (#1779 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1779>)
     * Increase understanding of TOTG path_tolerance_
     Tiny readability optimization - makes it a little easier for people to figure out what path_tolerance_ does
     * Update the units of path_tolerance_
     * Comment all 3 versions of computeTimeStamps
     * Add param for num_waypoints
     * More clarity on units

     Co-authored-by: Nathan Brooks <mailto:nathan.brooks@picknik.ai>
   * Fix BSD license in package.xml (#1796 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1796>)
     * fix BSD license in package.xml
     * this must also be spdx compliant
   * Remove unnecessary CMake variables and lists (#1790 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1790>)
   * Stopping calling MoveIt an alpha-stage project (#1789 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1789>)
   * Ensure all headers get installed within moveit_core directory (#1786 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1786>)
   * Set the resample_dt_ member of TOTG back to const (#1776 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1776>)
     * Set the resample_dt_ member of TOTG back to const
     * Remove unused TOTG instance in test
     Co-authored-by: Henning Kayser <mailto:henningkayser@picknik.ai>
     * Add "totg" to function name
     Co-authored-by: Henning Kayser <mailto:henningkayser@picknik.ai>
   * Remove Iterative Spline and Iterative Parabola time-param algorithms (v2) (#1780 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1780>)
     * Iterative parabolic parameterization fails for nonzero initial/final conditions
     * Iterative spline parameterization fails, too
     * Delete Iterative Spline & Iterative Parabola algorithms
   * Use target_include_directories (#1785 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1785>)
   * Minimize use of this-> (#1784 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1784>)
     It's often unnecessary. MoveIt already avoids this in most cases
     so this PR better cements that existing pattern.
   * Enable -Wold-style-cast (#1770 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1770>)
   * Add a version of TOTG computeTimeStamps() for a fixed num waypoints (#1771 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1771>)
     * Add a version of computeTimeStamps() to yield a fixed num. waypoints
     * Add unit test
     * Prevent an ambiguous function signature
     * Remove debugging stuff
     * Can't have fewer than 2 waypoints
     * Warning about sparse waypoint spacing
     * Doxygen comments
     * Clarify about changing the shape of the path
     * Better comment

   * Add -Wunused-function (#1754 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1754>)
   * Remove MOVEIT_LIB_NAME (#1751 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1751>)
     It's more readable and searchable if we just spell out the target
     name.
   * Add braces around blocks. (#999 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/999>)
   * Use <> for non-local headers (#1734 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1734>)
     Unless a header lives in the same or a child directory of the file
     including it, it's recommended to use <> for the #include statement.

   * Used C++ style cast instead of C style cast  (#1628 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1628>)

   * Cleanup lookup of planning pipelines in MoveItCpp (#1710 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1710>)
     * Revert "Add planner configurations to CHOMP and PILZ (#1522 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1522>)"
     * Cleanup lookup of planning pipelines
     Remove MoveItCpp::getPlanningPipelineNames(), which was obviously intended initially to provide a planning-group-based filter for all available planning pipelines: A pipeline was discarded for a group, if there were no planner_configs defined for that group on the parameter server.
     As pointed out in #1522 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1522>, only OMPL actually explicitly declares planner_configs on the parameter server.
     To enable all other pipelines as well (and thus circumventing the original filter mechanism), #1522 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1522> introduced empty dummy planner_configs for all other planners as well (CHOMP + Pilz).
     This, obviously, renders the whole filter mechanism useless. Thus, here we just remove the function getPlanningPipelineNames() and the corresponding member groups_pipelines_map_.
   * Small optimization in constructGoalConstraints() (#1707 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1707>)
     * Small optimization in constructGoalConstraints()
     * Quat defaults to unity

   * Fix clang-tidy issues (#1706 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1706>)
     * Blindly apply automatic clang-tidy fixes
     * Exemplarily cleanup a few automatic clang-tidy fixes
     * Clang-tidy fixups
     * Missed const-ref fixups
     * Fix unsupported non-const -> const
     * More fixes

   * Generate version.h with git branch and commit hash (#2793 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/2793>)
     * Generate version.h on every build and include git hash and branch/tag name
     * Don't generate "alpha" postfix on buildfarm
     * Show git version via moveit_version
     * Change version postfix: alpha -> devel
